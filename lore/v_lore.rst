    This lore exists to provide a basic framework on the history of San Andreas as a whole. The information below is considered readily available in character.

******************
Founding & History
******************
San Andreas is currently the 51st state of the United States of America, located in the northern Caribbean, south of Florida and north of Cuba, slightly eastward, with an approximate population equal to that of Northern California, 15 million. San Andreas was originally inhabited by a native population, which no longer exists, named the "Andreans" by the Spanish after the island was found by Christopher Columbus in 1492 during his exploration of the Caribbean. 

After Christopher Columbus' exploration of San Andreas and the surrounding Caribbean islands, the Spanish sent ships to colonize the state, which at the time, was considered a territory of Spain, specifically to take advantage of its fertile grounds and ideal climate for sugar cane and coffee farming, much like the French did with Hati in 1625. This colonial control resulted in San Andreas becoming one of the wealthiest colonies under Spanish control. 

Due to rampant piracy in the Caribbean area from the 16th Century to the early 19th Century, the Spanish formed several partnerships with the United States and private sailing companies to combat this piracy. This resulted in a series of mutual aid agreements later called the "Sugar Accords" by historians which were the precursors to the eventual sale of San Andreas to the United States in 1829, just as piracy in the Caribbean was being eradicated. 

Long after the sale of San Andreas in 1829 to the United States, several trade agreements remained, resulting in half of all sugar production being exported to Spain while the United States enjoyed a monopoly on the island of exclusive and fine coffee varieties. This notably includes a variation of the famous Blue Mountain coffee variety from the Blue Mountains of Jamacia. This San Andreas variety grows on and around Mountain Chiliad, giving it the name Chiliad Mountain coffee, one of the most profitable crops to this day after its introduction in 1854 to the island.

From 1920 to 1933, the United States enacted a nationwide ban on the production, importation, sale, or transportation of alcohol. This led to a rise in crime related to circumventing these laws. San Andreas played a key role in continuing to produce and export alcohol to the mainland United States, primarily in the form of rum from the vast amounts of sugarcane byproducts the island had at its disposal. During this period, the United States Federal Government attempted several times to raid various production facilities in San Andreas but failed due to rampant corruption in the state as a whole. Historians draw a parallel between this and the modern-day drug trade in Central and South America where politicians are regularly paid off or directly involved in and benefiting from the cartels who produce and export these illicit goods.

Many organized crime groups currently in San Andreas can draw many of their roots back to this period where fortunes were amassed or lost overnight and smuggling routes were established.

Los Santos County
=================
The county of Los Santos was founded in 1829 as part of the sale to the United States and was established as the first and only county-wide government in the state. This status remains to this day due to the size of the island.

Los Santos City
===============
The city of Los Santos, located in the southern portion of the island, was the first municipality and currently remains the largest in the entire state, founded in 1522 as one of the first locations original colonizers settled. There are several historical sites that are also attributed to the early settlers of San Andreas, however, of those original locations, Los Santos city is the only remaining one.

An infamous culture surrounds the city of Los Santos as over the years there has been an attempt to attract entertainment personalities to Vinewood, an imitation Hollywood. This imitation led to a bizarre subculture of America, often described as "Hollywood on steroids" where people continuously try to one-up each other to gain attention in the tabloids. These Vinewood superstars are often seen as the weird rejects of Hollywood.

Los Santos County Sheriff's Department
======================================
As part of the creation of the county in 1829, the Los Santos County Sheriff's Department was founded as the original law enforcement for the county and ultimately the state. Like many territories and states, the original law enforcement entities found themselves operating as Sheriff's Deputies or U.S. Marshals depending on the jurisdiction. Today, the state of San Andreas and its subsequent law enforcement structure are indistinguishable from other modern law enforcement practices.

Los Santos County Fire Department
=================================
A centralized county Fire Department was founded, known as the Los Santos County Fire Department, in 1850 after a series of wildfires had crippled the agriculture of the state. Many areas of the state are infertile or dry now as a result of overplanting and draining the soil of its natural resources. This dry climate results in severe brush fires and wild fires that commands the attention of the Fire Department regularly.

******************
Prominent Industry
******************
The island produces a vast quantity of sugar and its related byproducts such as molasses and rum. Coffee is also a large industry in San Andreas as well as tequila from blue agave plants which are favored crops on the island resulting from the hospitable environment. There are a multitude of fisheries throughout the island, bringing in large quantities of fish for consumption and exportation. 

Tourism is one of the largest industries in the state. Clear blue waters, lots of outdoor activities and a mild climate result in millions of tourists yearly as well as several ports for some of the largest cruise lines like Carnival and the Royal Caribbean. Tourists come from all over to visit the infamous "Vinewood Hills" and check out the bizarre culture fostered by actors, directors, and other entertainment personalities looking to strike it big.
